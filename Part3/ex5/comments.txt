For backend we already changed the image to more suitable in the previous exercise when trying to make the image smaller.
In exercise 3.3 the backend image started like "FROM golang:1.16" and in exercise 3.4 we used "FROM golang:alpine". 
The difference of the image sizes was 41 MB.

For frontend the image size was earlier 439 MB. After changing the Dockerfile to start like "FROM alpine:3.10" and doing 
necessary modifications for the application to work, the new size was 262 MB.

The new dockerfiles are in frontend and backend folders.
